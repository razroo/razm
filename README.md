# razm
Wasm first frontend framework middleware

The idea is that all computing should happen on Bun x Wasm if possible. All graphics should happen on Canvas if possible. Compute x rendering x server side should be one and the same. The syntax should have a native frontend feel.

It will be used as a middleware and piped into existing frontend frameworks
